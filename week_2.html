    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <p>Programming – making computers do what we want them to <br>
      3 categories of programming languages <br>
        Low-level programing – Language that is closer to the hardware of a computer <br>
        High-level programming – Languages that are easier to understand and write <br>
        Script – Languages that turn into machine code upon running <br>
    
        <br>
        <br>

    JavaScript – High level language that is compiled at run time <br>
      Also a dynamic langue, meaning that elements of the program can while its running <br>
      So, a program can run things in the background like type or spell checking <br>
    
      <br>

    HTML5 – The dominant programming language for the web <br>
      JavaScript is a key feature in using html5 to its fullest potential <br>
    
      <br>

    Unobtrusive JavaScript <br>
      Originally, java script was directly inputted into the html code <br>
        This made it much harder to read, write, and understand <br>
      A script tag can be used in the html to keep all of the JavaScript in one place <br>
        Making it much easier to understand and write <br>
      A link to a JavaScript file can be used script src=”main.js” <br>
        Takes all java code out of the html file creating an organized space for JavaScript code and allows for large functions to be written <br>

        <br>
        <br>

    JavaScript Arrays <br>
      Used to store multiple values in a single variable <br>
      To create an array: <br>
    var array_name = [values] <br>
      Can also use key word new to create an array: <br>
        Var array_name = new Array(values) <br>
    This way yields the same result as the other but is less simple, so using the other way is best <br>
      Can access the elements in an array using the index number <br>
        For example, [0] would point to the first element <br>
      Can change specific elements in array’s using the index <br>
        Array_name[0] =  “new value” <br>
      Full arrays can be acsessed by using the full name of the array <br>

      <br>
      <br>

    Arrays properties and methods <br>
      There are various properties and methods for using arrays in JavaScript <br>
      Length property <br>
        Returns the number of elements in the array <br>
      Sort() property <br>
        Sorts the array <br>
      Push() property <br>
        Adds new elements to the array <br>
      These are just a few examples, there are more <br>

      <br>
      <br>

    JavaScript Loops <br>
      For loop <br>
        Loops through a block of code a number of times <br>
          Syntax: <br>
            for (statement 1; statement 2; statement 3) {
                // code block to be executed
    }
     <br>
      For/in loop <br>	
        Loops through the properties of an object <br>
          Syntax: <br>
            for (x in object) {
            }
      <br>

      For/of loop <br>
        Loops through the values of an inerrable object <br>
          Syntax: <br>
            for (variable of iterable) {
            }
      <br>
      While loop <br>
        Loops through a block of code when a certain condition is true <br>
          Syntax: <br>
            while (condition) {
            }
      
    <br>

    Do/while loop <br>
        Loops through a block of code when certain condition is true (similar to while) <br>
          Syntax: <br>
            Do {
            }
            While (condition)

    <br>
    <br>
  
    JavaScript Functions <br>
      A function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task. <br>
      Use the function key word to define a function: 
        function my function() {
        }
      <br>
      The code inside a function will only execute when something invokes (calls) it <br>
      The return statement is used to return a value when the function is called <br>
      Local variables can be described in the scope of the function and only used in that scope <br>
      Functions offer a way to reuse code multiple times
