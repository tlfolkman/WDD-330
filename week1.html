        A computer cant remember anything on its own. It needs somthing designed to to store what it has done. <br>
        Using javascript, we can store any information we want for later. <br>
        This saving of data can be done even if the user leaves the page or refreshes it. <br>
        Javascript's local storage uses key-value pairs and can be used to save and retreive data. <br>
